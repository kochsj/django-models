# Django Modules

## Overview
Here we are working through our first modules using Django. The goal is to create a project and app with a few views. Using the admin feature of Django, we are adding a few entries from our module into the provided sqlite database. This repo is made for learning the basics of creating modules in Django and linking together templates, static files, and a database.
